# FrontEnd Challenge 001

It's not everything about CV, titles and portfolio. The most important for us is how you face a concrete challenge and how your approach to solve it looks like. Which is your way of thinking, how do you split out the problem, wich tools do you choose to use, ...

In order to understand all this we offer you the following challenge. This is a simplified but illustrative case of the kind of situations we have to deal with in our daily basics.

There is not time limitation but we suggest you to not spend more than a few hours on it. We are not looking for a bullet-proof solution we just want what it would be the first iteration, the first prototype version, the proof of concept, the most basic implementation that "gets the thing done".

## Challenge Description

### The API

Check out a simplified version of our [Surveys API](http://docs.surveysmock.apiary.io/)

There you should find examples of how to call each of the methods, for example:

    curl --include  "http://surveysmock.apiary.io/api/surveys/001"
    
_This is an API mockup so the methods are always gonna return the same result not matter which are the values of the params in the request_

### The functionality workflow

1. User sees all the available Surveys
1. User clicks on one Survey
1. User can complete the questions of the clicked survey
1. The answers are sent to the backend
1. A message is shown to the User: "Thanks for answer this Survey!"
1. The User can back to the point 1. again

### Programming Requirements

Everything has to work in the browser without any backend support (other than the API we provide).

Only one _html_ page (and as much JS as CSS files as you want).

You can use any frontend library you like, not limitation on quantity and size.

The solution has to work in Chrome last version, don't worry about the others.

### What we assess

- Legible, understandable and maintenable code
- Wisely balance between complexity of the problem and complexity of the solution
